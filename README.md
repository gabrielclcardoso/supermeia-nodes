**The biggest mixnode in Brazil**

This page is a hub for info on the mixnode ran by me. I'm a software engineer from Brazil who loves privacy and believes in the Nym mixnet as a way to change the surveillance business model of the internet.
#
* **Delegating to this node you're helping to decentralize the mixnet providers**: The node presented here is ran on [PhotonVPS](https://www.photonvps.com/). This choice was made because this VPS provider is barely used on the mixnet.

* **Delegating to this node you're helping to decentralize the mixnet geo-location**: The node presented here is located on SÃ£o Paulo, Brasil. This is because Brazil is a under represented country in the mixnet.

* **Delegating to this node you're helping tech inclusion for brazilians in low income areas**: 10% of all mixmining rewards made from this node will be donated to tech related social projects in Brazil.

*(The rewards will be donated every 3 months in order to contribute a greater sum to the projects)*
